I research, design and deploy Machine Learning systems, often working end-to-end, from real-time computer vision on edge devices to explainable AI. Currently working as an AI/ML Engineer at Teragonia. I have a track record of a couple of first-author publications, a thesis award and open source contributions.

Key Recent Projects:

* Teragonia: Building Agentic AI systems for retrieval.
* R&D at Oatmeal Health: Developed a multi-task learning pipeline for 3D lung CT scans, improving malignancy risk prediction by ~4% using hybrid architectures and foundation model fine-tuning
* Built production ML systems at MyGate: Developed quantized neural networks for edge devices, semantic search with LLMs, and containerized infrastructure.
* Research: Mitigating missingness bias in feature attribution (ICLR 2026, thesis runner-up award), focusing on transformer-based models for vision and language.

I hold a master's from UPenn where I focused on Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Optimization, and thrive at the intersection of research and engineering—whether advancing AI transparency or solving real-world problems in healthcare and sustainability.

I would love to connect if you're passionate about Machine Learning, interpretability, or AI for good!
