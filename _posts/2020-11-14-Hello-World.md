I can't remember the first time I thought about writing a blog, but the idea stuck with me and here we are. As of now I plan to divide this blog into three parts:

1. Random Thoughts and Musings
2. Technical Posts
3. Book Reviews
<br>

Random Thoughts and Musings( RTAM for short) will consist of any interesting thoughts I want to write about. Technical Posts will mainly cover explorations and experiments in machine learning.
Book Reviews will consist of reviews of books(surprise surprise!) that have affected me or have just piqued my interest.

I do not know whether I will one day advertise this blog, but I would lke this post to be a self-reminder that I am doing this for no one but myself. The fun is in the journey and I hope that I will never dwell too much on things like views and popularity.

I want to cover this better in a post of its own, with a really cool poem, Ithaka.

'Til next time!
