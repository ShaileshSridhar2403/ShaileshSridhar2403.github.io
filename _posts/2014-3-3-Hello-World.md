I can't remember the first time I thought about writing a blog, but the idea stuck with me and here we are. As of now I plan to divide this blog into two parts:

1. Random Thoughts and Musings
2. Technical Posts
3. Book Reviews
Random Thoughts and Musings(Let's call it RTAM for short) shall consist of any interesting thoughts which I wish to document. I hope to start Technical Posts with mainly explorations and experiments in machine learning, for which I have a lot lined up in my mental to-do list.
Book Reviews will consist of reviews of books(surprise surprise!) that have affected me or have just piqued my interest.

I do not know whether I will one day advertise this blog, but I would lke this post to be a reminder to myself that it I am doing this for no one but myself. The fun is in the journey and I hope that I will never dwell too much on things like views and popularity.

I guess this is better covered in a post of its own, with one of my favourite poems, Ithaka.

'Til next time!
