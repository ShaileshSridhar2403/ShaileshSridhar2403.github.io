**ðŸ”¬ Ongoing Research** - This work is currently in progress, with new results and publications coming soon.

### Overview

* Working on reducing the bias in interpretability algorithms for black box machine learning models, especially transformers across text, vision and tabular modalities

* Showed and reduced bias in LLM variants (e.g., Llama, Mistral) using prompt engineering, statistical and optimization techniques

* Developing novel techniques to identify and mitigate biases in feature attribution methods

* Won runner-up award for best thesis in my department

### Status
Current ongoing research with the Brachiolab at the University of Pennsylvania
