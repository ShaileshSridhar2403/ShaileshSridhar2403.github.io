### Overview

* Proposed a novel adaptive learning rate based on the Lipschitz conntinous property of Mean Square Error to compute learning rate in shallow neural networks

* Proposed a novel differentiable activation function, A-ReLU, which works well in conjunction with said adaptive learning rate

* Performed experiments on a well known large Gene Expression Inference dataset with a shallow architecture constrained by limited computing resources

* Achieved SOTA-comparable performance with half the parameters
