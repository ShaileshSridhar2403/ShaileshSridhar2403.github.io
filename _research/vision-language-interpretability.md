### Overview

* Developed novel interpretability methods for Vision-Language models like CLIP at the Nguyen Lab, Auburn University

* Discovered critical spurious behaviour where removing important image features counter-intuitively increases model confidence

* Research focused on understanding and exposing potential failure modes in vision-language models



### Institution
Research Associate at Nguyen Lab, Auburn University
