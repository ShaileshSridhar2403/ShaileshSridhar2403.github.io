## Re-CDEP: ML Reproducibility Challenge

### Overview

* Won a cash award for Successfully reimplementing "Interpretations are Useful:.Penalizing Explanations to Align Neural Networks with Prior Knowledge", an ICML 2020 paper, in Keras.

* Involved training models to align them with desired explanations, so that they do not learn spurious correlations

* Modalities includedd images (ISIC skin cancer dataset, DecoyMNIST) and text (COMPAS dataset)

* Required writing PyTorchâ€™s `unpool` function from scratch in Tensorflow. This later became a patch pushed to the Tensorflow Addons repository
