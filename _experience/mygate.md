### Semantic FAQ Search based Chatbot

* Developed, deployed into production and maintained system for fast Semantic text search involving FAISS indexed LLM (BERT) embeddings and postgresql database
  * Used by thousands of customers
  * Finetuned, benchmarked and compared different LLM architectures on FAQ retrieval task
  * Improved performance with downstream processing such as keyword search and spelling correction using Gradient Boosted Decision trees

### Real Time Computer Vision Applications on Edge devices

* Designed training and fine-tuning regimes for quantized object detection networks
  * Led to ~8% performance improvement
  * Proposed, implemented synthetic training data generation for license plate images with a pix2pix Generative Adversarial Network, improving performance by ~4%

* Implemented and deployed into production containerized microservice based pipeline for face authentication
  * Designed and implemented a novel efficient algorithm to select most important frames
  * Developed MLOps infrastructure, including a React based dashboard and APIs
  * Maintained and evaluated performance metrics

### Face Authentication Pipeline

* Researched and implemented efficient, parallelized facial image preprocessing methods
  * Spoof detection
  * Quality detection
  * Performance optimization
